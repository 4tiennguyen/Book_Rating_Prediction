# Stats_170AB -- Capstone Project

This is my Capstone project. I and my teammate were curious about how differently the Goodreads and Amazon users review a book, so below we  
* Obtained and clean large Amazon and Goodreads datasets.
* Utilized multiprocessing to maximize CPU utilization to drastically speed up the cleaning process by 100 times.
* Utilized EDA to explore the characteristics of the datasets and to choose suitable algorithms for the datasets.
* Utilized Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
* Used various statistical tools and machine learning algorithms to predict the rating differences between the Amazon rating and the Goodreads rating given the user reviews of a book.
* Provided insights and conclusions about the datasets from the results of EDA and machine learning models.
* Wrote a report communicating the results to non-technical and technical audiences.
