## Datasets

There are 4 datasets for our project: Goodreads metadata, Goodreads reviews, Amazon metadata, Amazon reviews. Since the files are too large and take too long to run, we have created a sample dataset of them and uploaded under the following names:
   1. ```gr_metadata_sample.csv```: contains 
   3. am_reviews.csv
   4. am_metadata.csv
   5. am_gr_LDA_sample.csv ( contains ASIN feature along with 35 proportion topics features which were extracted from LDA model)
