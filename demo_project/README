Our project is on Predicting the Difference between Goodreads Ratings and Amazon Ratings

This folder is the subset of the complete_project file. It contains small sample datasets and only Jupyter Notebooks.

## Datasets

There are 4 datasets for our project. Since the files are too large and take too long to run, we have created a sample dataset of them and uploaded under the following names:
   1. gr_reviews.csv
   2. gr_metadata.csv
   3. am_reviews.csv
   4. am_metadata.csv
   5. am_gr_LDA_sample.csv ( contains ASIN feature along with 35 proportion topics features which were extracted from LDA model)
