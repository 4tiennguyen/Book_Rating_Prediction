# Stats_170AB

Our project is on Predicting the Difference between Goodreads Ratings and Amazon Ratings

There are two main folders:
1. complete_project: This folder contains all of the full code files from the beginning to end 
2. demo_project : This folder is the subset of the complete_project file. It contains small sample datasets and only Jupyter Notebooks.
   The folder provides brief instructions on how to obtain the final results (FOR GRADING PURPOSES)
