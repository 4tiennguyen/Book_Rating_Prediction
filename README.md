Our project is on Predicting the Difference between Goodreads Ratings and Amazon Ratings

There are two main folders:
   1. complete_project: This folder contains all of the full code files from the beginning to end 
   2. demo_project : This folder is the subset of the complete_project file. It contains small sample datasets and only Jupyter Notebooks.
      The folder provides brief instructions on how to obtain the final results (FOR GRADING PURPOSES)

## Datasets

There are 4 datasets for our project. Since the files are too large and take too long to run, we have created a sample dataset of them and uploaded under the following names:
   1. gr_reviews.csv
   2. gr_metadata.csv
   3. am_reviews.csv
   4. am_metadata.csv
